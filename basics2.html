					Your thumb should be pressing comfortably against one of the wider surfaces of the racquet grip while the rest of your hand holds the racquet as if you’re shaking a person’s hand.
				<br> 
				<br>
					The way you hold your racket can affect the flexibility of your wrist.
				<br>
				<br>
					In order to execute strong badminton strokes with high accuracy, your wrist needs to be flexible.
				<br>
				<br>
					To achieve this, make sure you:
				<br>
				<br>
					Do not grip your racquet too tightly. This will make your wrist less flexible in rotating and flicking.<br><br>
					Use ONLY your thumb, index, and middle finger to control the racket. 
					Your last 2 fingers should rest comfortably on the badminton grip to balance the weight of the racquet. 
					By doing this, it enables your wrist to be more flexible and move more freely.

					Your thumb does not necessarily have to press against the wider surface of the badminton grip for a forehand stroke.
					<br>
					<br>
					Your index finger should be the one “in control” in a forehand stroke. 
					<br>
					<br>
					This simply means using your index finger to push the racquet forward while doing a forehand stroke.
					<br>
					<br>
					However, rest your thumb comfortably anywhere near the wider surface of the badminton grip to enable you to change to a backhand grip quickly.

				<p>
					The key to perform strong backhands depends on how you hold your racquet. The true power of a badminton backhand shot comes from the push of your thumb.
					<br>
					<br>
					A backhand stroke requires you to USE YOUR THUMB. So you should now press your thumb on the wider surface of the badminton grip. 
					<br>
					<br>
					Relax your index finger and move it closer to your middle finger.
					<br>
					<br>
					The backhand grip will look like you’re doing a ‘thumbs up’.

        <p><center>Effective Badminton Footwork: A Complete Guide for Beginners</center></p>
        <hr>
				<p><center>
					Many people neglect badminton footwork because it might not seem important at all.
					<br>
					You might hear some people say “why care about footwork when I can do a 300km/h smash”. 
					<br>
					<br>
					Are you thinking that way too?
					<br>
					<br>
					However I would say that the footwork is THE most important skill you should master. 
					<br>
					It’s even more important than smashing!
					<br>
					<br>
					This is because an effective and organised footwork provides superb speed and 
					<br>
					agility which enables the player to move around the badminton court swiftly and return every shuttlecock. 
					<br>
					So what if you can do a 300km/h smash when you cannot even reach the shuttlecock in time?
					<br>
					<br>
					Playing badminton is all about speed. 
					<br>
					The shuttlecock can move extremely fast and you must move faster than the shuttlecock to be able to hit it.

				<p>
					Always remember your base (starting point) will be at the red dot in the middle. The arrows indicates the possible movements around the court.
					<br>
					<br>
					Every time you move away from your base to hit the shuttle, you MUST QUICKLY return to your base to prepare yourself for your opponent’s shot
					<br>
					<br>
					For instance, you move to point A to take a shuttle and then stay there. Your opponent then returns the shuttle back to you at point B. You are less likely able to get to point B in time from point A.
					<br>
					<br>
					Conversely, if you quickly return to your base after hitting the shuttle at point A, you will definitely be able to return the shuttle at point B.

        <hr>
			<p><center>
				It’s VERY IMPORTANT to perform your badminton strokes correctly in order to execute quality badminton shots.
				<br>
				<br>
				Remember, you MUST master these basic strokes in order to play like a pro!
				<br>
				<br>
				Basically a stroke is the swing motion of your racket arm. 
				<br>
				It is not a badminton shot. However you’ll need to perform these strokes to hit certain shots.
				<br>
				<br>
				The power of any badminton shot comes from how well you perform your  strokes (swing motion). 
				<br>
				A beginner should FIRST learn how to perform the CORRECT strokes.
			</center></p>
		<hr>
		<p><center>The basic strokes are:</center></p>

					<br>
					Why is it important to perform the correct strokes from the start?
					<br>
					<br>
					It is impossible to hit strong backhand shots in badminton if you perform the wrong backhand stroke.
					<br>
					<br>
					<center>
					Let’s look at an example…
					</center>
					<br>
					John did not learn the correct badminton backhand stroke and have been hitting backhands using ‘his own style’ for several years.
					<br>
					<br>
					After few years of wrong backhand stroke technique, John finds it difficult to ‘re-learn’ the correct backhand stroke technique. 
					<br>
					<br>
					He is already too used to the wrong technique.He has developed a bad habit!

        <p><center>Badminton Serve</center></p>
        <hr>
			<p>
			<center>
				A badminton serve can be performed using 2 methods (high serve and low serve), 
				<br>
				depending on where you want the shuttlecock to land.
				<br>
				There are certain rules that you must follow when making a service.
			</center>
			</p>
		<hr>
		<p><center>1. The High Badminton Serve</center></p>
		<div class="image-container" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
			<div class="image">
				<img src="high.jpg" alt="high serve Photo" class="photo-content">
				<img src="serve.png" alt="serve Photo" class="photo-content">
			</div>
			<div class="image-text">
				<p>
				This type of serve is usually executed when you want the shuttle to land at the back end of the court.
				A good high serve must have the shuttle dropping steeply downwards at the back end of the court.
				<br>
				<br>
				A high serve will prevent your opponent from executing a strong smash.
				Instead, a lob or a drop is more expected from your opponent 
				<br>
				(unless they can do a jump smash).
				<br>
				<br>
				Try to serve the shuttlecock to your opponent’s backhand area. 
				<br>
				The objective is to force your opponent to use his backhand. 
				<br>
				This is because most badminton players, even world class player, 
				<br>
				have weaker backhands. 
				<br>
				(compared to their forehands).
				</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<p><center>2.The Low Badminton Serve</center></p>
		<div class="image-container" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
			<div class="image">
				<img src="low.jpg" alt="low serve Photo" class="photo-content">
				<img src="serve1.jpg" alt="serve1 Photo" class="photo-content">
			</div>
			<div class="image-text">
				<p>
					The low serve is used when you want the shuttlecock to land in front of the court 
					<br>
					(in front of your opponent).
					<br><br>
					A GOOD low serve will have the shuttlecock flying JUST ABOVE THE NET.
					If not, your opponent will have the chance to dash forward and smash the shuttle down to you.
					<br>
					<br>
					A low serve, when executed beautifully, prevents your opponent from making an offensive shot.
					Unlike the high serve, you can let the shuttle drop anywhere in front 
					<br>
					(forehand area or backhand area of your opponent).
					<br>
					<br>
					Neither makes a difference because it does not disrupt your opponent’s footwork.

        <p><center>Badminton Stance</center></p>
        <hr>
		<p><center>What’s a badminton stance?</center></p>
			<p>
			<center>
				It is the way you stand when retrieving certain shots from your opponent.
				This may be your first time hearing of this term. So far I have not seen any online badminton resource that covers this topic. 
				But I thought it’s good information to share with you especially if you want to improve your games.
				<br>
				<br>
				Basically there’re 3 types of badminton stances, They are:
				<br>
				<br>
				Attacking Stance
				<br>
				Defensive Stance
				<br>
				Net Stance
				<br>
				<br>
				Using the correct stance to retrieve your opponent’s shots will definitely give you an advantage in a rally.
			</center>
			</p>
		<hr>
		<p><center>1. Attacking Stance</center></p>
			<div class="image-container" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
				<div class="image">
					<img src="attack.jpg" alt="attack Photo" class="photo-content">
				</div>
				<div class="image-text">
					<p>
						You’ll need to use this stance whenever you hit an overhead forehand stroke.<br><br>

						To get into the attacking stance,<br><br>

						Turn your body facing the side of the court.<br>
						Place your racket leg behind; your non-racket leg forward.<br>
						Both legs should be shoulder width apart.<br>
						Raise your racket and non-racket arm<br><br>
						Hitting forehand strokes via the attacking stance enables you to hit powerful shots. 
						It also enables you to recover quickly after you perform your shot.<br><br>

						When to use?<br>

						Whenever your opponent lifts or clear the shuttle high up to you, move towards the shuttle and adopt the attacking stance.

						The key to strong defense is to retrieve your opponent’s smash via the defensive stance.<br><br>
						To get into the defensive stance,<br><br>
						Face your body to the front of the court.<br>
						Place your racket in front of you, around waist height, and pointing slightly forward.<br>
						Raise your non-racket arm for better balance.<br>
						When you’re on a defensive stance, you can cover wider angles.<br><br>
						For example, you’ll find it a lot
						easier to retrieve smashes hit to your body, left hand side, or right hand side.<br><br>
						When to use?<br>
						Whenever you hit a High Clear or perform a High Serve, move to your base position and adopt the defensive stance. 
						Ideally, you want to be at your base position before your opponent hits the attacking shot.<br>
						Just in case you want more, here’s a page on badminton defense.

						The net stance enables you to take the shuttle at the highest point when you’re at the net.  
						When exchanging net shots, every millisecond counts! So make sure you take the shuttle as early as possible.<br><br>

						To get into the net stance,<br><br>

						Place your racket foot forward; non-racket foot at the back.<br>
						Place your racket in front of your body, slightly above waist height.<br>
						Raise your non-racket arm for body balance.<br>
						Place your body weight slightly forward and get ready to pounce forward.<br><br>
						When to use?<br>

						Normally the only time you need to adopt the net stance is after you perform a Tumbling Net Shot.<br>

						Your body’s posture will naturally be on the badminton net stance after you hit the tumbling net shot.
						So STAY THERE and be ready to pounce forward to perform the net kill if your opponent hits a net shot.
